#Road Safety Monitoring System
To ensure effective use and user engagement, the system caters to two primary user roles: the Driver and the Admin. 
The Driver interacts with the system through a dedicated website, receiving real-time information about road conditions and hazards. 
Simultaneously, the Admin has access to a comprehensive dashboard that incorporates feedback provided by drivers. 
The Admin is also responsible for updating the system with new data related to road conditions.
